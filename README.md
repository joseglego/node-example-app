# node-example-app

It's a step by step tutorial/commits which show the evolution from scratch to an Node API made with: `express` and `sequelize` (with postgresql). You can read the instruction or follow commit by commit the evolution of this.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need:
- (My recommendation is use [nodenv](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv). But it's not necessary if you are starting and looks complicated for you)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Also, (PostgreSQL)(https://www.postgresql.org/)

### Installing

#### Database
- 0. For the DB, you'll need an user with some special super powers (Login & CreateDB, and all). So, in `psql` run:

```psql
CREATE ROLE nodeuser;
ALTER ROLE nodeuser WITH LOGIN;
ALTER ROLE nodeuser WITH CREATEDB;
GRANT ALL ON schema public TO nodeuser;
```

- 1.A Clone [this repo](https://github.com/joseglego/node-example-app): `git@github.com:joseglego/node-example-app.git` with:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:joseglego/node-example-app.git
cd node-example-app
```

- 1.B Or start by your self:
```sh
mkdir node-example-app
cd node-example-app
```

### Commits / Step by Step
#### 0: Initial commit
Nothing special, define `package.json` and define first needs.

#### 1: npm run start
Write `node server/app.js` everytime is boring. So, we define a npm command. Now, we'll do `npm run start`

#### 2: nodemon
Turn off/on everyime we do a change in the project is boring too. So, we use nodemon instead of `node` (And redefine `npm run start`)

#### 3: Sequelize
Check Database if you skip that part. You will need an user with some privileges.
Include requisites:
```sh
npm install sequelize sequelize-cli pg-hstore express
```

Once done, we can start with the database. In bash run:
```sh
sequelize-cli init
sequelize-cli db:create
```
P.S.: If you can't find `sequelize-cli` try: `npx sequelize-cli` or `node node_modules/.bin/sequelize-cli`

#### 4: Model Enterprise
Create first model:

```sh
sequelize-cli model:create --name Enterprise --attributes name:string,countryId:string,address:string,phoneNumber:string
sequelize-cli db:migrate
```
